# WeightWatchers_Assignment
WeightWatchers Assignment Project

I have built Cucumber framework to complete my assignment. I have created 1 feature file for each assignment. All requirements have been captured in Gherkin and I have completed the implementation through Step Definitions.

I have designed all the solutions dynamic & free from hard-coding. You can test with multiple inputs.
